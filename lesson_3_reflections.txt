(1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

(a) Having a remote repository is a great idea for when you're collaborating with other people
across the globe.

Everyone can access the same most recent version of the project at a central location
and branch from it to work on things like features, bug fixes, improvements to formatting, 
improvements to code efficiency, improvements to comments, improvements to documentation, etc.

(b) It also nicely functions as a backup of our project files. It ensures we always have at
least two storage locations for our files, locally on at least one device and one remote location.
And when collaborating, the number of more or less recent versions of the project increases
linearly with the number of collaborators. This can be seen as an extra safety net. The more
collaborators, the more potential backups we have (assuming people are regular collaborators
and don't immediately delete their project files after a contribution.)

(c) Finally, what should flow into our consideration at least for using GitHub, is the
public nature of it (assuming we don't wish to pay the monthly subscription fee for private
repositories.) Our files would be open for access by the public, so if we have concerns regarding
our intellectual property, we should be aware of that.
