What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Running "git init" will initialize a repository in the current directory.
Initializing a repository means git will install a hidden folder called .git
in this directory, which contains metadata files for tracking the changes
and contents of this directory.

Initializing a repository will not automatically make a first commit to contain
all the files of the repository in their pristine, clean state for an initial commit.
Files must be manually and purposely added to the first commit to initiate tracking
from there on out. This is because some files may not be desired to be tracked and
git couldn't know on its own which files a user wishes to track.




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The working directly is simply a container for all of our files.
The repository is a container for all of our commits, our logical changes over time.
The staging area is an intermediary place between the working directory and the
repository for us to place files on for our next commit.

It helps us manually let git know which files belong to our commit, our "logical change",
and which don't. Ultimately, it simply gives us more fine-grained control over our commits.
Imagine a situation where we factually made more than one logical change by adding logical
changes in multiple files (note: not *one* logical change across multiple files, but
multiple logical changes in multiple files), but still want to adhere to our "one commit = one logical change" principle. We may have done so accidentally. The staging area then
helps us still keep our commits clean and simple and adhere to our "one logical change per
commit principle" by adding only the files affected by each logical change to the staging
area and then making a commit and repeating this process for all the logical changes we
made.
